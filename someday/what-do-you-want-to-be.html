                        <p>i've seen this question asked a lot: "what would you be if you had no limitations and restrictions?" and it's more often than not tied to "tell me what you wanted to be as a kid."</p>
                        
                        <p>i hate how both are the same thing.</p>
                        
                        <p>there was literally no wrong when you dreamt, no labels of being overly aspirational. no remarks of you being snobby. just the real deal.</p>
                        
                        <p>i struggle finding an answer that's "realistic" enough for the present and still makes me happy. to be honest, bleh.</p>
                        
                        <p>maybe that's the point though. maybe the question itself is broken. maybe we're not supposed to have one definitive answer that satisfies both our childhood dreams and our adult practicalities.</p>
                        
                        <p>maybe the real answer is still becoming.</p>
                        
                        <p>in the quest to update this blog asap and find momentum, i'm realizing that the limitation isn't external anymore. it's not about what the world will let me do. it's about what i'm brave enough to try.</p>
                        
                        <p>the sky is still there. i think i just forgot how to look up.</p>
