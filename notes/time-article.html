                        <p>i'm done with 4 semesters of my college. i've got one enemy and it's the passage of time. i know everyone goes around saying that it is fleeting but i really do feel i wasn't able to live through the moments that were mine. all i did was practically just exhaust myself noticing the headlights of my future and yet, surprisingly, i dont feel prepared or equipped enough.</p>
                        
                        <p>it would be unfair if i don't mention the good sexy times i've lived through. as cliche as it sounds, its been a hell of a ride and i'm really excited for everything i'm gonna live through no matter how hard that shit might be.</p>
