                <p class="theme-text">each of these songs represents a different phase, emotion, or realization in my life. they're not just background music - they're the soundtrack to moments of clarity, confusion, growth, and sometimes just getting through the day. music has this incredible way of capturing feelings that words alone can't express.</p>

            <section class="theme-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">the bigger picture</h2>
                <p class="theme-text">finding meaning in music, art, or any form of expression helps me stay grounded. it's a reminder that we're all trying to figure things out, that our experiences aren't unique, and that there's beauty in the struggle. these songs are my anchors when everything else feels uncertain.</p>
