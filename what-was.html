                            <p>i spent fourteen formative years at <a href="https://lamartinieregirlscollegelko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="school-link">la martiniere girls college, lucknow</a> - a 150-year-old institution that shaped everything i am. it was the place where a 3-year-old could imagine anything was possible, and where a 17-year-old left believing it actually was.</p>
                            <p>it was where dreams took shape and learned to soar. most days, i live wrapped in the nostalgia of those years. my heart feels like it's made of memory foam - soft, impressionable, holding the shape of every moment long after it's passed. i carry all of it with me and i truly hope to make my alma mater proud.</p>
